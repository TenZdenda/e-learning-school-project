                    Our Danish courses are taught by Eliza, who adores languages & everything connected to them!

                <p>
                    Being a graduate of the Philological department of the Saint-Petersburg State University with specialization in Danish & Scandinavian studies, Eliza possesses great knowledge within the field, that she generously shares both at our courses & private lessons.

                    Besides languages, Eliza is also interested in Business & Economics, and possesses as well a second degree from Copenhagen Business School in International Business & Politics, which many of her other projects are connected to.
